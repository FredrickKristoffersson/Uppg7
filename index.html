        Hello! IÂ´m Fredrick and I live in a small town called Sala. Here I live with my girlfriend, 
        our two children and two crazy cats as well. Today I am working as a electrical designer at Vattenfall Eldistribution 
        and have handled many kinds of projects, such as building new infrastructure between cities, 
        smaller installations of renewable energy sources, contact for certain municipalities, and everything in between. 
        As of today, I am studying Java and Javascript at Lernia for two years. Its one of my childhood fascinations, 
        that I have, part by growing up with games and computers as such, as long as I remember. 
        I am really exited about this and would love to see what this journey will take me.
